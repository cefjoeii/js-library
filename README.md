# JS Snippets
A collection of reusable plain JS code. They must atleast support IE10. For more compatibility at the moment, these are ES5 code. You're free to convert yours to ES6/ES7/ES+ anytime as you wish.

Note: Though snippets can simply be put on GitHub Gist, it'd feel more organized if they are here in a repository.
